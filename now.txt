# I can build   aws on my pc, tag and push it to the ecr
# I can build local on my pc, and start it as well
# Both instance run with no problem w/the credential abstraction 

Next is to sort out:

- One Docker file / multi stage builds
- integrate .env    into compose  file?
- integrate build   into compose  file?
- integrate content into  compose file?
