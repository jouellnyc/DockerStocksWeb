#AWS is all set except for the flask db connect error / 404
# I can build aws on my pc, tag and push it to the ecr and the 
# isntance will run with no problem w/o the credential abstractions


Next is to sort of local vs aws docker BUILDs, and the files/what to put in them
- dev vs prod gunicorn
- dev vs prod .myenv
- self.client_connect_string = (f"mongodb://{self.mongohost}:{self.port}")
  #self.client_connect_string = f"mongodb+srv://{self.mongousername}:{self.mongopassword}@{self.mongohost}/{self.database}?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
- integrate .env into build and compose file?
