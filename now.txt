#AWS is all set except for the flask db connect error / 404
# I can build   aws on my pc, tag and push it to the ecr
# I can build local on my pc, and start it as well
# Both instance run with no problem w/the credential abstraction 

Next is to sort out:
- dev vs prod gunicorn

- self.client_connect_string = (f"mongodb://{self.mongohost}:{self.port}")
  #self.client_connect_string = f"mongodb+srv://{self.mongousername}:{self.mongopassword}@{self.mongohost}/{self.database}?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

- integrate .env into build and compose file and/or btp.sh?

- One Docker file / multi stage builds
